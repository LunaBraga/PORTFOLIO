## About me 
For 5 years I have been working with many projects: landing pages and e-commerce websites among others. Usually I use the Waterfall methodology but I am also versed in Agile and Scrum. I cooperate with a team of programmers. Currently, I am learning Automated & Manualy Tested,  HTML, CSS and Java Script. I want to widen my knowledge of modern technologies. 


## My experience 

My previous experience was initially associated with working as a PR manager and then for 10 years as an Account Manager. So far, I have worked on projects related to new technologies: creating websites and applications. Due to the fact that I always wanted to ensure the best performance of the projects, all of them were tested by me. I made Excel included all Bugs that I found for Developers. We are also working together on all projects improvement.
