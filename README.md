## ⚜ About me ⚜
I am a tester and I constantly expand the scope of my skills. I absorb new knowledge very quickly, I am empathetic, patient and diligent. I take care of good relations in the team and of communicating information necessary for the proper execution of the project on an ongoing basis. I have many years of experience working with software development teams. Currently, I expand my knowledge in the field of modern technologies.


## ⚜ My experience ⚜

My previous experience was initially associated with working as a PR manager and then for 10 years as an Account Manager. So far, I have worked on projects related to new technologies: creating websites and applications. Due to the fact that I always wanted to ensure the best performance of the projects, all of them were tested by me. I made Excel included all Bugs that I found for Developers. We are also working together on all projects improvement.
